reducing experiences to binary classifications

the question one asks, \
the person who asked it, \
the topics the question covers, \
whether in science, \
technology, \
nature, \
the body, \
the soul, \
the mind, \
and its sub-topics 

whether the question provides options, \
the options it gives, \
the general sentiment of the public to such question in question, \
how many people got it right, \
how many people got it wrong, \
how long it took for them to answer, \
the discussions they had in regard to the question, recorded, \
in plain text, like one who types in a courtroom 

and finally, the answers the question deems acceptable
