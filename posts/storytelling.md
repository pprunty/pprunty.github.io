Paddy English Man, Paddy Scotish Man and Paddy Irish Man were all walking along a beach, when suddenly, they came upon a 
lady lying by the shore, with no legs, and no arms. They looked at each other and said, "we should help her." 
They approached the woman, when Paddy English Man asked her, "excuse me, is there anything _I_ could do for you?." She looked 
up at the men and said, "well, now that you ask, I've never been hugged before." So Paddy English Man bend over, and hugged
the poor lady. Then Paddy Scotish Man looked down to her and said, "is there anything _I_ can do for you?" She replied,
"well, I've never been kissed before." So Paddy Scotish Man bend down and kissed her on the lips. Then, Paddy Irish Man 
asked, "is there anything _I_ can do for you?" "Well," she said hesitantly, "I've never been fucked before." Paddy Irish 
Man looked down at her, and then out to sea, looked back and said "well, you're fucked now, the tide's coming in."
