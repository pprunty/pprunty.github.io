Recently, I noticed a wave of social media posts on "how to manage multiple interests" gain much attention. They usually involve some Zen analytics, reflection, and time management diagrams to narrow your interests. The goal? To put you on the path to success by specialising in that one thing or idea that'll make you 'great'. As someone who's always enjoyed being sporadic in my interests, pardon my French, but I think it's all bullshit.

After dropping out of a General Engineering program three weeks in, I returned to college a year later to study a joint degree in Math and English. Nowadays, people view these subjects as opposites on the intellectual spectrum. They say things like:

"You're either a Math person or an English person."

So wait, what are you saying? A maths student can't be creative? And an English student can't be rational?

_Bullshit._

From the 1920s to the 1970s, college curricula for Mathematics students often included general education requirements that spanned various disciplines, _including_ English literature. The idea of a well-rounded education was common. It meant that even in Maths, a broader academic base was expected. So don't tell me the best mathematicians are not creative, or the best writers are irrational.

Additionally, I received a social experience like no other through doing the degree I did. What other degree would you have been sitting beside a young man who smelled of false tan in an English literature tutorial, only to scutter across to the science building an hour later for a Mathematics lecture where everybody looked the same?

During my undergraduate degree, I burned through books, and I mean _burned_ through them: fiction, non-fiction, biographical, you name it. This was partly down to being assigned these books in college modules and wholly down to my mammoth 45-minute commute back and forth to college, which I had to do on the train every day.

Fast-forward to today, where I work as a software developer in a completely different world. One day, I was chatting with a senior colleague, a self-described hippy. We discussed books, and I confessed:

"Man, I don't know why, but I can't get back into reading. Whenever I read a book, I put it down at the beginning or just before the end."

He replied in his typical laid-back, philosophical fashion:

"Bro, that's okay—it probably means you don't like the book."

**LIGHTBULB**.

Yeah, I didn't like the book. After all, who says you need to read the whole thing? If a book has you hooked, you'll read it back to front. You might even go back for seconds.

This realisation reminded me of another passion in my life: exercise.

I love exercise. Moreover, I love the feeling exercise gives you after you finish a tough session. As a child, my parents signed me up for almost every sport they could find: swimming, taekwondo, judo, boxing, hurling, Gaelic football - the list goes on. I can see now why they were frustrated. After buying me an expensive new judo kimono for Christmas (which I asked for), I told them I didn't want to go to judo anymore.

Today, I continue exploring various sports, albeit with a little more self-awareness. I do jiu-jitsu and triathlon now. When I get bored with running, I cycle. When I get bored with cycling, I swim. When I get bored with triathlon, I roll. You get my drift. And yeah, I might never win a triathlon, run a sub-3-hour marathon, or get a black belt. But that's OK, because I'm happy to be there, tapped in, doing it, and getting a little better each day.

There's this saying: 

_"Jack of all trades, master of none."_

To that, I ask you, what do you want to be a master in? What do you want people to approach you for and ask for your expertise? If you have an answer, then pursue it. If you're not already doing it, then do it. Shit, get a PhD and _really_ lean into it. If you don't know what you want to be a master in, keep jacking along until you find what you want to do, or die with no regrets. After all, a jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.

There's no manual for how you should live your life, never mind balance your interests. It's your life; do what you want. If you find pleasure in doing something, do it. If it gets boring, find something else that gives you that pleasure and do that.

Don't get caught up in the capitalist mantra: go all in, get the bag, be better than everyone else, win. That's a recipe for everlasting anxiety. Be a better version of yourself in whatever you do each day, and take pleasure in it.

If you're not spending much time on a planned task, you probably no longer like it. On the other hand, if you find yourself happily engrossed in something all day, then revel in it, and you'll forget all about the other things.

Do whatever you want, when you want to do it. The most important thing is that you show up and do it.

Variety, after all, is the spice of life.
