Recently, I’ve seen a bunch of YouTube videos and Medium articles on “how to manage multiple interests” yada,
yada
get a lot of attention. They usually involve narrowing your interests down through some Zen analytics, reflection and
time management planning diagrams in order to put you on the path of success by focusing on that one thing or idea that'll make you 'great'.
As somebody who for as long as I can remember, enjoys being sporadic in my interests, pardon my French, but I think it's all bullshit.

After initially dropping out of a general Engineering undergraduate degree after ehm, 3 weeks, I decided to go back to
college a year later to study a joint degree in Mathematics and English literature. Today, people often put these two
subjects
on opposite sides of the intellectual spectrum and say “you’re either a Math person, or an English person”. So wait,
what
are you saying? A maths student can’t be creative? And an English student can’t be rational? I disagree.

Back in the day, from the 1920s through to the 1970s (sorry if you were born between then, and you're reading this, but
you old), college curricula for Mathematics students often included general education requirements that spanned various
disciplines, _including_ English literature. The concept of a well-rounded education was prevalent, meaning that even
specialized fields like Mathematics were expected to have a broader academic foundation. So don't tell me the greatest
mathematicians were not creative, or the best writers irrational? Additionally, I received a social experience like no
other through doing the degree I did. What other degree would have you sitting beside a young man who smelled of false
tan in
an English literature tutorial, only to scutter across to the science building an hour later for a Mathematics lecture
where
everybody looked the same?

During my undergraduate degree, I burned through books, and I mean _burned_ through them; fiction, non-fiction,
biographical, you name it. This was partly down to having being assigned these books to read in college modules and wholly down to my
mammoth 45-minute
commute back-and-forth to college I had to do on the train every day. That brings me to present day, working as a
software developer
in a completely different world. I found myself one day, not too long ago, chatting to one of my hippy
teammates from Argentina, I said "man, I don't know why, but I just can't get back into reading — everytime I read a
book, I end
up putting it down at the beginning or just before the end." He replied, in typical fashion, "man, maybe that's OK - it
probably means you just don't like the book." **LIGHTBULB**. Yeah, I probably didn't like the book. After all, who said
you _need_ to read it all? If you like the book, you'll read it back-to-front.

I love exercise. Moreover, I love the feeling exercise gives you after you finish a really tough session. As a child,
my parents signed me up to nearly every sport they could find; swimming, taekwondo, judo, boxing, hurling, gaelic
football, the list goes on. They were, in hindsight, understandably frustrated after buying me an expensive new judo
kimono for Christmas that I asked for only to find out that I don't want to go to judo anymore... Today, I carry on spreading
out my interest in different sports, albeit with a little bit more self-awareness. I do jiu jitsu and triathlon now,
which is great, because when I get bored with running, I cycle, when I get bored with cycling, I swim, when I get bored with triathlon,
I roll — you get my drift. And yeah, I might never win a triathlon, run a sub 3-hour marathon, or get a black belt. But that’s OK, because I’m happy to just be
there, tapped in, doing it, and getting a little better each day.

There's this saying: _"jack of all trades, master of none."_ To that, I ask you, what do you want to be a master
in? What do you want people to approach you for and ask for your expertise in? If you have an answer, then pursue it, if
you're not already doing it, then do it. Shit, get PhD and _really_ lean into it. If you don’t know what you want to be
a master in, then keep jacking along until you find what you want to do, or die with no regrets.

There's no manual for how you should live your life, never-mind balance your interests. It's your life, do what you
want. If you find pleasure in doing something, do it, if it gets boring, find something else which gives you that pleasure and do that.
Don't get caught up in the oppressive capitalist mantra that you gotta go all in, get the bag, be better than everybody
else, win. That's a recipe for everlasting anxiety. Be a better version of yourself in whatever you do, each day, and
take pleasure in it. If you find yourself not spending as much time doing that thing you wanted to do, it's probably because
you don't like doing it anymore. Conversely, if you find yourself doing something from morning until night, then revel
in it, and you'll forget all about the other things.

I will finish by enlightening you on the former saying, with the full quotation that is not too often heard today:
**_jack of all trades, master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one_**.


[//]: # (Let me drop the full version of that old saying on you: "Jack of all trades, master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one." Isn't that what we've been getting at? Don't let anyone tell you to narrow down your interests or manage your time more efficiently. Just do it all. Read half a book if you want. Switch sports when you get bored. Chase whatever sparks your curiosity. At the end of the day, it's your life - there's no manual, no right way to balance your interests. So be that jack of all trades, dabble in everything, and enjoy the variety. After all, that's not just the spice of life - it's the whole damn meal.)

And that brings me to another saying which I will finish on, _**variety is the spice of life**_, and the full quotation of the former saying:
Jack of all trades, master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.
