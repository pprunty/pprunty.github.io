Recently, I've seen a flurry of YouTube videos and Medium articles on "how to manage multiple interests" getting a lot
of attention. They typically involve narrowing your interests through some Zen analytics, reflection, and time
management planning diagrams. The goal? To put you on the path to success by specializing in that one thing or idea that'll
make you 'great'. As someone who's always enjoyed being sporadic in my interests, pardon my French, but I think it's all
bullshit.

After initially dropping out of a general Engineering undergraduate degree after, ehm, 3 weeks, I decided to go back to
college a year later to study a joint degree in Mathematics and English literature. Today, people often put these two
subjects on opposite sides of the intellectual spectrum and say:

"You're either a Math person or an English person." 

So wait, what are you saying? A maths student can't be creative? And an English student can't be rational?

_Bullshit._

From the 1920s through to the 1970s (sorry if you were born between then and you're reading this, but
you old), college curricula for Mathematics students often included general education requirements that spanned various
disciplines, _including_ English literature. The concept of a well-rounded education was prevalent, meaning that even
specialized fields like Mathematics were expected to have a broader academic foundation. So don't tell me the best
mathematicians are not creative, or the best writers irrational.

Additionally, I received a social experience like no other through doing the degree I did. What other degree would have
you sitting beside a young man who smelled of false tan in an English literature tutorial, only to scutter across to the
science building an hour later for a Mathematics lecture where everybody looked the same?

During my undergraduate degree, I burned through books, and I mean _burned_ through them; fiction, non-fiction,
biographical, you name it. This was partly down to having been assigned these books in college modules and wholly down
to my mammoth 45-minute commute back-and-forth to college I had to do on the train every day. That brings me to present
day, working as a software developer in a completely different world. I found myself one day chatting
to my hippy Argentinian teammate about books, I said:

"Man, I don't know why, but I just can't get back into reading — every time I read a book, I end up putting it down at
the beginning or just before the end."

He replied, in typical fashion:

"Bro, that's OK - it probably means you don't like the book."

**LIGHTBULB**. 

Yeah, I probably didn't like the book. After all, who made it a rule that you gotta real the whole
thing? If a book has you hooked, you'll read it back-to-front. You might even go back for seconds.

For as long as I can remember, I have enjoyed exercise. Moreover, I love the feeling exercise gives you after you finish a really tough session. As a child, my
parents signed me up for nearly every sport they could find: swimming, taekwondo, judo, boxing, hurling, gaelic
football, the list goes on. They were, in hindsight, understandably frustrated after buying me an expensive new judo
kimono for Christmas that I asked for, only to find out that I don't want to go to judo anymore...

Today, I carry on spreading out my interest in different sports, albeit with a little bit more self-awareness. I do jiu
jitsu and triathlon now, which is great, because when I get bored with running, I cycle, when I get bored with cycling,
I swim, when I get bored with triathlon, I roll — you get my drift. And yeah, I might never win a triathlon, run a sub
3-hour marathon, or get a black belt. But that's OK, because I'm happy to just be there, tapped in, doing it, and
getting a little better each day.

There's this saying: "Jack of all trades, master of none."

To that, I ask you, what do you want to be a master in? What do you want people to approach you for and ask for your
expertise in? If you have an answer, then pursue it. If you're not already doing it, then do it. Shit, get a PhD and
_really_ lean into it. If you don't know what you want to be a master in, then keep jacking along until you find what
you
want to do, or die with no regrets. After all, a jack of all trades is a master of none, but often times better than a 
master of one.

There's no manual for how you should live your life, never mind balance your interests. It's your life, do what you
want. If you find pleasure in doing something, do it. If it gets boring, find something else which gives you that
pleasure and do that. 

Don't get caught up in the oppressive capitalist mantra that you gotta go all in, get the bag, be
better than everybody else, win. That's a recipe for everlasting anxiety. Be a better version of yourself in whatever
you do, each day, and take pleasure in it. 

If you find yourself not spending as much time doing that thing you had
planned
to do, it's probably because you don't like doing it anymore. Conversely, if you find yourself doing something from
morning until night, then revel in it, and you'll forget all about the other things.

Do whatever you want, when you want to do it. The most important thing to remember is that you show up, and 
just do it.

Variety, after all, is the spice of life.
