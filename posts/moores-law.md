## Introduction
[Brief introduction to Moore's Law and its significance in technological advancement]

transistor approach their limit: the size of an atom.

conflict: does a human brain evolve with technological advancements, or does it make us _dumb_?

## The AI Revolution and Human Cognition
[This section serves as the hook, presenting the central question and setting up the tension between AI advancement and human cognitive capabilities]

"Is There a Moore's Law for the Human Brain?"
a) "As AI systems shatter records in processing power, a startling question emerges: Is the human brain being left behind in the dust of silicon evolution?"
b) "Imagine a world where human cognition doubles in capacity every two years. Sounds far-fetched? So did Moore's Law when it was first proposed for computer chips."
c) "In the race between silicon and synapses, who's really winning? The answer might reshape our understanding of human potential."
