As Artificially Intelligent (AI) systems improve at an exponential rate, are we enhancing our cognitive abilities, or
conversely, is our reliance on technology leading to a cognitive decline?

In 1965, Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, observed what would become known today as Moore's Law. Moore's Law states
that the number of transistors
that can be packed onto a piece of silicon doubles approximately every two years. Its limit being the size of a single
atom.
_Huh,_ it would probably be a bad idea for them to go any smaller than that right? You wouldn't want things to start blowing up...

[//]: # (The pressing question remains: Is there a Moore's Law for the human brain? As AI systems grow more sophisticated, do we risk becoming 'dumber', or does technology have the potential to enhance our cognitive functions in ways we've yet to fully understand?)

## The AI Revolution and Human Cognition

[This section serves as the hook, presenting the central question and setting up the tension between AI advancement and human cognitive capabilities]

This principle has propelled the advancement of AI, as more transistors mean more powerful hardware systems to run AI
programs on. Some fear that these AI systems might eventually surpass human capabilities and 'take over'. However,
OpenAI's latest GPT 4o model utilizes up to 175 billion
parameters and still falls way short of the human brain's estimated 100 trillion synaptic connections. This vast
difference highlights the unique complexity and evolutionary refinement of the human brain, which spans 3 billion years
of natural evolution.

So, is there a Moore's Law equivalent for the evolution of the human brain?
