Rising Action:

The Birth of uTorrent:
Developed by Ludvig Strigeus in 2005, uTorrent was designed to be a small, fast, and feature-rich BitTorrent client. Its initial release was a mere 180 kilobytes, earning it the nickname "µTorrent" (micro-torrent).
BitTorrent Protocol:
At its core, uTorrent utilizes the BitTorrent protocol, a peer-to-peer file sharing method that breaks files into small pieces, allowing users to download from multiple sources simultaneously.

DHT (Distributed Hash Table): Enables "trackerless" torrents, improving file availability.
Peer Exchange: Allows clients to share peer lists, speeding up the discovery of new peers.
UPnP and NAT-PMP: Automatic port forwarding for easier connectivity.


Web-based UI:
uTorrent introduced a web interface, allowing users to control their downloads remotely from any device with a web browser.
