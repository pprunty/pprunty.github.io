Of late, I find myself grappling with the desire to expand on the points I want to get across to the reader in 
an educational and accessible manner with the need to remove redundancy and conform to the mantra: less is more.

They say less is more â€” but in the writing world, that's only if you can make more less.

I believe striking this balance is ultimately what separates an average writer from a great one.

For some, the expectation is for a slow, deliberate experience that leaves them having learned something new. For the insidious doom-scrolling-attention-deficit-disordered generation, who want it _quick_, and want it _now_, maybe not so much.

And so, that forces us as writers to adapt. 

Ever go to a fancy restaurant or watch The Bear? If so, you might remember the one-word mantra repeated by the
main character and top chef Carmy to his co-chefs:

_"Subtract."_

Now, my non-expert theory on why restaurants and chefs do this is because they want to provide you with high-quality 
substance but also leave you wanting more. 

They do this with every single dish they serve, making you wait a considerable time for each, and then, hit you with the dessert.

It's like edging but with food.

I appreciate the artistry. But I must admit, I also appreciate triple cheeseburgers, soda refills and spice-bags. 

The difference is I don't feel the same way after eating at a fancy restaurant compared to the way I do after eating at
McDonald's.

It wasn't too little, it wasn't too much. It was just right.
