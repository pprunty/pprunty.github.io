maggots as fodder
keeping flies as pets
how long have they been around
how long do they live
how many scpecies of them there are

P.S
and yes, i realize this article is high autism

Introduction:
Buzzing around our picnics, hovering near our trash bins, and occasionally landing on our food, flies are a common nuisance in our daily lives. But beyond their pesky reputation lies a world of fascinating behaviors, complex social structures, and surprising intelligence that has long gone unnoticed.
Hook:
Did you know that flies can count, recognize human faces, and even experience fear? These tiny creatures, often dismissed as mere pests, have been hiding remarkable secrets right under our noses.
Rising Action:

The Fly's Eye View
Flies possess compound eyes with up to 6,000 lenses, giving them a near 360-degree view of the world. A 2019 study in the journal "Current Biology" revealed that flies can detect motion up to five times faster than humans, explaining their uncanny ability to evade our swatting attempts.
Mathematical Marvels
Research published in "Science" in 2022 demonstrated that fruit flies can perform addition and subtraction using visual cues. This discovery challenges our understanding of insect cognition and raises questions about the evolutionary benefits of numerical ability in flies.
Social Butterflies... or Flies
Contrary to popular belief, flies engage in complex social behaviors. A 2020 study in "Nature Communications" showed that fruit flies form hierarchical societies with leaders and followers, exhibiting behaviors reminiscent of more advanced social animals.

Climax:
The most startling revelation comes from a groundbreaking 2023 study published in "PNAS." Researchers at the University of Oxford discovered that flies can recognize and remember human faces. Using a specially designed maze, they demonstrated that flies could distinguish between different human faces and associate them with positive or negative experiences.
Falling Action:

Ecological Importance
While often viewed as pests, flies play crucial roles in ecosystems. They serve as pollinators for many plants and as a food source for numerous animals. A 2021 study in "Ecological Entomology" highlighted the significant contribution of flies to global pollination, second only to bees.
Medical Marvels
The humble maggot (fly larva) has found its place in modern medicine. Maggot therapy, approved by the FDA in 2004, is used to clean non-healing wounds. Recent research in the "Journal of Wound Care" (2022) has shown promising results in treating antibiotic-resistant infections.
Future Research
As we uncover more about flies' cognitive abilities and social structures, new avenues of research are opening up. Scientists are now exploring how understanding fly behavior could lead to advancements in fields ranging from robotics to neuroscience.

Conclusion:
From their lightning-fast perception to their mathematical prowess and face recognition abilities, flies have proven to be far more than the simple nuisances we've long considered them to be. As we continue to unravel the secrets of these ubiquitous insects, we're not just gaining a better understanding of flies â€“ we're gaining new insights into cognition, social behavior, and the complexity of life itself. The next time a fly buzzes past you, take a moment to consider the remarkable creature behind those compound eyes. It might just be counting, remembering your face, or engaging in complex social interactions right before your eyes.
