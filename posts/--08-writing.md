I'm a software developer and blogger and I can't help but find my engineering thought process leak into my writing. In
general, I try to follow a five-step process outlined by Elon Musk:

Of late, I find myself grappling with the desire to expand on the points I want to get across to the reader
in an educational and accessible manner with my need to remove redundancy and conform to the mantra: less is more.

They say less is more - but in the writing world, that's only if you can make more less. 

I believe striking this balance is ultimately what separates an average writer from a great one.

that's only

1. Ensure no unnecessary work is being done.
2. Delete a part of existing process.
3. Simplify and Optimize.
4. Accelerate the cycle time.
5. ~~Automate~~

Of course, automation doesn't really apply to us, authentic stoneage writers, whom choose not to leverage Large Language Models 
(LLMs) and software to automate the generation and publication of their writing.
