be greedy when those are fearful and be fearful when those are greedy.


next time you hear of a big thing, be fearful. as tempting as it might be, don't do it. the fact you have been told about 
it via multiple sources is indication enough, it's already too late.

for me it was cryptocurrency, I admittely made a lot of money in the early days, before losing a lot more than I made.

before cyrpto, it was tech companies (dotcom), before that it was poppies.


it's like that scene of matthew mccaughney, when the investor says they want to take there money and cash out, the broker comes up with another bright idea, another _opportunity_.
