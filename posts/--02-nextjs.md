Developing a front-end user interface is often simply a question of making things look good. Seldomly, developers
focus on areas which are not plain to the eye. This guide will walk through how integrating the following
components can elevate your NextJS/ReactJS project to the next level:

1. **React Memoization**: Enhances performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders and recalculations, comparing previous and current props to avoid redundant updates, which results in smoother and faster UI updates.
2. **NextJS Image Optimization (static and server optimization)**: Automatically optimizes images by providing a blur effect while they load, which improves load times and enhances the user experience by reducing perceived latency.
3. **NextJS Scroll Restoration**: Automatically restores the scroll position to its previous state when navigating back to a page, providing a seamless user experience and preserving the context for users.
4. **Markdown**: 
5. **Dynamic Route Matching (slugs)**: Uses URL-friendly identifiers to create dynamic routes, making it easier to handle content-based navigation and improve SEO by using meaningful paths.
6. **Open Graph Metatags (SEO)**: Adds metadata to web pages to control how they are displayed when shared on social media, improving visibility and click-through rates by enhancing the presentation of shared content.
7. **Native Share API**: Allows content sharing directly through mobile device interfaces, such as sharing a blog post via messaging apps or social media platforms, enhancing user interaction.
8. **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**: Enable offline functionality and the ability to download the website as an app, improving user accessibility and engagement even without an internet connection.

## 1. React Memoization

React memoization optimizes application performance by minimizing re-renders. Under the hood, React caches component 
outputs and only recalculates when props change, using shallow comparison to detect changes. This approach prevents 
unnecessary re-rendering of components when the page is loaded by using the cached result, enhancing UI responsiveness 
smoothly and efficiently.



## 2. NextJS Image Optimization

NextJS offers image optimization out-of-the-box that automatically optimizes images as they load. This feature 
includes a blur effect placeholder, reducing perceived latency and significantly improving the loading time, which 
enhances the overall user experience. To use ...

## 3. NextJS Scroll Restoration

In single-page applications, maintaining the user's scroll position can be crucial for user experience. NextJS supports 
automatic scroll restoration, especially useful when navigating back to a previously visited page. To enable this feature, 
include the following in your `next.config.mjs` file.

```javascript
export default {
    experimental: {
        scrollRestoration: true,
    },
};
```

_Note: The `scrollRestoration` is currently labeled an 'experimental' feature in NextJS version `14.2.3`. I have not 
experienced any issues with this feature, however, you will receive warnings to use this feature with caution._

## 4. Dynamic Route Matching 

```shell
pages/
├── _app.tsx
├── _document.tsx
├── blog
│   ├── [slug].tsx
│   └── page
│       └── [page].tsx
├── index.tsx
└── privacy.tsx
```

## 5. Open Graph Meta Tags

Enhancing your project’s visibility on social media platforms can be achieved by integrating Open Graph meta tags. 
These tags help define how URLs are displayed when shared, improving engagement and click-through rates.


To preview how your webpage is previewed on different social media platforms, you can use the online provider
[opengraph.xyz](https://www.opengraph.xyz/).

## 6. Native Share API

Incorporating the Native Share API enables content sharing through native mobile device capabilities. It enhances user 
interaction by allowing the sharing of content directly via messaging apps or social platforms.

## 7. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
