My father is a tradesman. Barring the foundations of our home, there
is little in the house he has not his signature etched on


And in terms of what I can offer my partner, 


He had help. Two sons who run around at his beck and call and as the years went by, would huff and puff at having to. On a building site these younger  men are called apprentices, more colloquially they’re called runners.

He built us a home.

I build websites.

He built a home for my mother

Instead of laying insulation to keep my pregannt mother warm during cold Irish winters, I can offer a website and one-way-ticket on the capitalist express.


I have worked on web applications that have enabled the companies I’ve worked for make tens of millions in revenue. But I haven’t seen the fruits of my labor.

Some time ago, the powers to be must must have drawn a line in the sand between the business people and the engineers. You build and we’ll sell.

After all, if I build a feature for a website which saves or makes the company millions and I know about it, they’re not going to have much to sell after they’ve given me my fair share.
