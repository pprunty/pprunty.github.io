Wherein we lay \
A crocodile balloon in the heat forced us still.

We lay there, breathing \
Dusk unto dawn, \
Together, unable to move. 

Afraid to break this altogether silence, \
Like two become one, \
Like this love is fun, \
Like dawn would never come.


In time, you are there with me still, unmoving, \
I wished then that tomorrow would never come.

But tomorrow becomes today, \
And \
Today becomes tomorrow. \
And were I with you still, I would forget this moving: 

And together we could be each other's undoing, \
But then build ourselves up, and up.
